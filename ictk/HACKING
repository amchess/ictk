HACKING - contributing to the ictk project
-------


CODING STYLE
------------

When I contribute a patch to your project I'll do it your way.  If you want 
me to accept your patch you'll follow mine.

Indents: I use 3-spaces indent.  I have vi set shiftwidth=3.  I also have 
autoindent set on.  This might make the code look wierd on your screen but 
it looks fine on mine.

K&R hitchcocks: I use curly braces (hitchcocks) on the same line as the 'if'
and the 'else', 'try' and 'catch', and also on the same line as the function.
I also keep the open and closing hitchcock for the 'if' on a different lin
from the 'else'.  For example:
    if ( ) {
    }
    else {
    }

Function & Variable names: should follow Java recommended standards.

Screen width: I use an 80-char wide xterm.  Old-school, I know.  Please,
cut your lines to fit this standard.

Internal Classes: I use these rarely.  Normally I promote them to full fledged
classes.  If it's internal there better be a good reason.

Imports: I use import statements not java.lang.String.  The latter makes
the lines too long and in general just looks ugly.

For everything else just look at the code and do what I do.


PACKAGES
--------

If you're writing a variant of an already existing game make sure its 
package goes in a subdirectory of the main game.  So if you were to add
CrazyHouse to ictk you should put in under /ictk/boardgame/chess/crazyhouse.

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

As you can see almost all my methods have JavaDoc headers.  Yours should too.
