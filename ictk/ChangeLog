Legend:
   [all]    applies to all
   [dev]    applies to some development tool
   [test]   applies to the test suite
   [chess]  applies to chess model or io
   [gui]    applies to gui components
   [net]    applies to internet communication features
   [fics]   applies to support for the www.freechess.org server
   [icc]    applies to support for the www.chessclub.com server

In progress
   [net]    added FICS support to main branch of library
   [fics]   removed BlockMode message chunking
   [fics]   recoded login sequence to not use StringBuffer
            Also now correctly determines beginning of session.
   [fics]   added guest account detection on login
   [fics]   added Timeseal support
            thanks to Alexander Maryanovsky (Jin)
   [fics]   changed FICS.*Events to FICS*.EventParsers to benefit from
            loose coupling of parsers to events.  This will allow server
	    event translations.
   [fics]   added test suites for the parsers
   [fics]   added template files for Parsers and ParserTest to auto generate
            these files.

0.1.1 - *IN PROGRESS* bug fixes
   [dev]    fixed 758852 - build.xml needed manual doodling for JUNIT to work.
            The old build.xml file required the user to change the default
	    home directory and possibly the junit.home variable.  The fix
	    includes using Ant's ability to detect environment variables on
	    most platforms.  An error is printed if Ant can't find that info
	    so users can manually set it.
	    {thanks: Jerome Zago for the bug report & suggestions}

   [test]   fixed 771165 - testCheckmateSmother3: wrong assertions
            Test was passing because of bug 771063.  Test corrected.
	    {thanks: Jerome Zago for the bug report}
   [test]   added debug info for PGNWriter

   [chess]  fixed 759466 - PGN variation w/o space seperating paren and move.
            For example: (2.Bc4) instead of ( 2.Bc4 )
	    {thanks: Jerome Zago for the bug report & patch}
   [chess]  fixed 771063 - double-check does not generate correct legal moves.
            {thanks: Jerome Zago and David Spencer for reporting the bug}
   [chess]  fixed 773597 - annotation w/o space between delimeters caused error
            {thanks: Jerome Zago for the bug report}
   [chess]  fixed 771199 - annotation before move list not handled correctly
            Now supports comments before games and before moves.  For there
	    to be a comment before a move (called a Prenotation) in a PGN
	    there must be a comment after the previous move -- except
	    in the case of a variation.
   [chess]  fixed 774076 - PGNWriter error on writing null GameInfo
   [chess]  fixed 774085 - PGNWriter error on writing null History
   [chess]  added ChessBoard.isDoubleCheck() and changed isCheck() to be
            true when double-check is true.
   [chess]  added Move.getPrenotation() and family.  These are for 
            comments/annotations before the move.
   [chess]  added PGNReader/Writer now handle Pre-Notations.  Prenotations
            might come as comments before a game or before variations.  They
	    are also determined when there are N comments in a row;
	    N-1 will be appended to the Annotation of the former move
	    and the Nth will become the Prenotation of the latter move.
